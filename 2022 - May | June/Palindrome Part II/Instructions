Palindrome Part II - Instructions
Strings may consist of several words separated by spaces. For example, the string "never odd or even" becomes a palindrome if the spaces are removed.

The program flowchart below represents an algorithm to produce a string OutString by removing all spaces from a string InString.
Refer to the flowchart 

Use the flowchart to write a function RemoveSpaces() which takes InString as a parameter, and returns OutString. The function should remove all spaces from Instring.

YOU MUST NOT USE .strip()
