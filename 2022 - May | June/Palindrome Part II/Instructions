Palindrome Part II - Instructions
Strings may consist of several words separated by spaces. For example, the string "never odd or even" becomes a palindrome if the spaces are removed.

The program flowchart below represents an algorithm to produce a string OutString by removing all spaces from a string InString.
Refer to the flowchart 
(https://github.com/cosalt/Programming-challenges/blob/2cd6a0c71958052d493166fbec529c5fae1a4d69/2022%20-%20May%20%7C%20June/Palindrome%20Part%20II/download.png)
Use the flowchart to write a function RemoveSpaces() which takes InString as a parameter, and returns OutString. The function should remove all spaces from Instring.

YOU MUST NOT USE .strip()
