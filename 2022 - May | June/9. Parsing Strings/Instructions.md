## Instructions
A string represents a series of whole numbers, separated by commas.

For example:
"12,13,451,22"

Assume that:
• the comma character ',' is used as a separator
• the string contains only the characters '0' to '9' and the comma character ','.

A procedure Parse will:
• take the string as a parameter
• extract each number in turn
• calculate the total value and average value of all the numbers
• output the total and average values with a suitable message.
