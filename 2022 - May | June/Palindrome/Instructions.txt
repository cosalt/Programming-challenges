Palindrome - Instructions
A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards as backwards.

The following strings are examples of palindromes:
"Racecar"
"madam"
"12344321"

Upper-case and lower-case characters need to be treated the same. For example, 'A' is equivalent to 'a'.

A function IsPalindrome() will take a string parameter. The function will return TRUE if the string is a palindrome and will return FALSE if the string is not a palindrome.
