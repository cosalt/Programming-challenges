## Instructions
A procedure LastLines() will:
• take the name of a text file as a parameter
• output the last three lines from that file, in the same order as they appear in the file.

Note:
• Use local variables LineX, LineY and LineZ to store the three lines from the file.
• You may assume the file exists and contains at least three lines. Write the procedure LastLines().

The procedure can be tested using the .txt file provided.

You must complete this challenge without using .readlines() and instead using .readline()
