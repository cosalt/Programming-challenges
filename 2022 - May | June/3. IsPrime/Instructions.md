## Instructions

### An algorithm is described as follows:

Input an integer value.
Jump to step 6 if the value is less than zero.
Call the function IsPrime() using the integer value as a parameter.
Keep a count of the number of times function IsPrime() returns TRUE.
Repeat from step 1.
Output the value of the count with a suitable message.
IsPrime() has already been programmed for you in main.py
