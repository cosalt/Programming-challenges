# Programming challenges
a bunch of python programming challenges, projects and questions(mostly from gcse/alev past papers).

for the questions,
there'll be the instructions on one page and a worked solution on the other. your solution may be different to mine as we all think differently, eitherway, if it works, it's probably correct. 

Also included, are old projects made a year or two ago - as I didn't know how to fully use github.
