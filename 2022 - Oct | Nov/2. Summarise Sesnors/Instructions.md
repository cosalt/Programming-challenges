## Instructions

A program uses two 1D arrays of type integer.

Array1 contains 600 elements and Array2 contains 200 elements.

Array1 contains sample values read from a sensor. The sensor always takes three consecutive samples and all of these values are stored in Array1.

A procedure Summarise() will calculate the average of three consecutive values from Array1 and write the result to Array2.

This will be repeated for all values in Array1.
