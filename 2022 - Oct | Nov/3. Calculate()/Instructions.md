## Instructions
A simple arithmetic expression is stored as a string in the format:

"Value1-Operator-Value2"

An operator character is one of the following: '+' '−' '*' '/'

Example arithmetic expression strings: "803+1904" "34/7"

A procedure Calculate() will:
• take an arithmetic expression string as a parameter
• evaluate the expression
• output the result.

Assume:
• the string contains only numeric digits and a single operator character
• Value1 and Value2 represent integer values
• Value1 and Value2 are unsigned (they will not be preceded by '+' or '−').
