# Movies API
This API will provide data for an initial collection of 50 movies. Users can access information such as the movie title, release date, and description. Each movie is assigned a unique ID ranging from 1 to 50, which can be used to identify specific movies. Additionally, the API allows users to update existing entries, modify details, add new movies, and delete any movie record as needed.
